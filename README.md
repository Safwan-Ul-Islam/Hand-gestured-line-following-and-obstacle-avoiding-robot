## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. **Gesture Control Mode**

   * MPU6050 sensor worn on the hand detects pitch/roll movements.
   * Arduino processes sensor data and sends corresponding motor commands to the robot.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance Mode**

   * Ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles within 100 cm.
   * The robot stops or reroutes automatically to avoid collisions.

3. **Line Following Mode**

   * IR sensors detect line contrast on the floor.
   * Arduino adjusts motor speeds to keep the robot on track.

**Mode Switching:**

* Modes can be changed via a button or Bluetooth commands without rewiring.
